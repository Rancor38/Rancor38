## A little bit about me

My name is Zakariah, and I am a **software engineer**.

ðŸŒ± I'm super enthusiastic when I find a new technology for developing reactive designs. In 2022 learned **React** and **Django**, and in 2023 became an **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**. I also really like playing around with CSS and motion libraries in my spare time.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm always looking to collaborate on new projects in order to expand my skills and get different perspectives on development, as I know that there's a near infinite font of knowledge in this feild.

ðŸ“« If you need to reach me, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zakariah-om/), or email me at **zak.text@gmail.com**, I'm always happy to chat.

âš¡ Outside of web development, I really enjoy tabletop roleplaying games, like [Dungeons and Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/), and [MÃ¶rk Borg](https://morkborg.com/), and play at least once a week with the same group of friends that got me into web design. I really like being creative, and am always down to connect about *any* tabletop game.
