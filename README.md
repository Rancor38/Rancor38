## A little bit about me

My name is Zakariah, and I am a new **software engineer** and I am persuing a career in **web and game development**.

🌱 I really love working with motion elements, and making responsive applications. I'm super enthusiastic when I find a new technology for developing reactive designs. In 2022 learned **React** and **Django**, and **Ember** is the next framwork I'm looking at developing in. I also really like playing around with CSS and motion libraries to make apps more slick and responsive.

👯 I'm always looking to callaborate on new projects in order to expand my skills and get different perspectives on develpment, as I know that. there's a near infinite font of knowledge I've just dipped my toe into.

📫 If you need to reach me, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zakariah-om/), or email me at **zak.text@gmail.com**, I'm always happy to chat.

⚡ Outside of web development, I really enjoy tabletop roleplaying games, like [Dungeons and Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/), and [Mörk Borg](https://morkborg.com/), and play at least once a week with the same group of friends that got me into web design. I really like being creative, and am always down to connect about any tabletop game.
